The OpenLayers Editor (OLE) is a set of OpenLayers widgets developed by GeOps http://www.geops.de.

The source repository is on GitHub https://github.com/geops/ole.
The original set of widgets has been extended (Upload/Download/Text Labels and some more) for use in Heron,
but possibly in any OpenLayers app.
These extensions are maintained in GitHub as well:
https://github.com/justb4/ole as a fork of the GeOps master branch.

At the moment (14.mrt.2013) this fork is awaiting inclusion into the master branch.

The directory 'justb4.ole' below contains the OLE library.


Use the minimized ole/ole.min.js version in your production app.

See also the Heron example "editorbasics" how to use. Only CSS and minifed JS needs to be included:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../ux/oleditor/ole/client/theme/geosilk/geosilk.css" type="text/css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="../../ux/oleditor/ole/ole.min.js"></script>
